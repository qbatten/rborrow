I can provide any proof/info you require and payment through PayPal as it offers protection for the lender.\n\nI hope someone is able to help even if they are only able to loan a portion of the loan request. Open to borrowing from a few lenders if this is likely to get my request fulfilled.\n\nI have received my contract and would show it if it's a matter of proof of my internship and salary.",

No big deal usually except the payroll company that I worked for on this show (I am Union Stagehand IATSE Local 720) has not had me on one of there calls in quite some time. During my hiatus from them, they created a new web portal for the employees to fill out all of their hiring, taxes, emergency contacts paperwork, etc.\n\nHaving filled all of this out I was fairly happy knowing that I would be getting a decent check from them for my time effort. Boy, was I wrong. The usual girl who handles the direct deposits wasn't in the office due to how large the show was that they had going on. Her temporary helper decided to use my old hard copy direct deposit form instead of my new and updated one. Thus my paycheck was sent to an old, closed Wells Fargo account. Having caught this error on my check stub, I called them to get them to fix it. \n\nBad news is they won't be able to send the check to me until they get it back from Wells Fargo which could be as late as Wednesday. Then I have to wait for them to send it to me. So I'm currently looking at finally getting paid by Friday possibly. I'm pretty broke right now and could use some floater cash for dog food, groceries, gas money, etc until this is all resolved. I'll pay you back by no later than Sept 14, 2018 and will include an interest payment for $40 upon payment. \n\nI really appreciate any one who took the time to read this and anyone who can help as well. I'll gladly provide any documents or information that you want/need. Thank you in advance. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9a5pqz/req_200_las_vegas_nv_usa_sept_14_or_sooner_zelle/",

I hope this being my first time here doesn\u2019t ruin my chances of getting help, as I could really use it. \n\nI live with bipolar disorder, as well as chronic fatigue, for which I receive disability benefits, which I\u2019ll receive on the 1st of the month. I\u2019m out of medication however, and due for refill which I desperately need to pick up tomorrow before things start to get bad. I\u2019m also out of gas (luckily I have a gas can and live around the corner from a gas station). My bank account is at negative $6.00 at the moment and I\u2019m just short of panicking. \n\nA little about me: I\u2019m 27 years old and grew up here in Winston-Salem. I\u2019m a street performing musician (singer-songwriter/guitarist) and artist (painter & stone carver) and though my music is widely appreciated in my area, I\u2019m facing difficult times, politically, in my city, as I await help from the ACLU of NC who are representing my case against Winston-Salem\u2019s unconstitutional restrictions on street music. I work very hard to get by, and while I am extremely thankful to have recently begun receiving disability benefits after a 6 year wait, the diminishing tips I\u2019m making street performing are no longer being enough to get me through. \n\nI\u2019m waiting for my certification to be approved, having trained as a Peer Support Specialist, which will allow me to make around $15/hr working with people who are living with similar struggles to my own. Once I receive my certification, I expect my life to change drastically, but until then I\u2019m living in my cousin\u2019s unfinished basement, sleeping on his futon, and just trying my best to not live as or feel like a waste of space. \n\nAll of that said, I just need a bit of help in this case, and will gladly reimburse that help, along with an extra $15 for the trouble. If you\u2019ve read this far though, whether you can help or not, I truly appreciate it. ",

        "body": "Hi All, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst time asking for a loan on here but due to unforeseen circumstances, I have to swallow my pride and ask for assistance from one of you kind strangers. Recently moved to San Diego for a job and since the job pays well I'll be able to return the money (+interest) within a month. Started the job 3 weeks ago and used most of my funds I had saved for moving expenses and down payment on the room I'm renting. I stretched myself thin but figured I could swing it based on the compensation from this current gig. Unfortunately, my Pomeranian back in my home state was attacked by a husky at a dog park (he's staying with my younger sister who is a college student) and I paid just north of $4500 for the surgeries, medication and treatment (have invoices for proof if requested). While we are in the process of pressing charges to collect that amount from the shitty dog owner of the husky, I currently don't even have enough for gas to get to and from work. I'm not asking for charity since I'm paying back the sum +interest,  but just need some kindness from a stranger who's a bit more liquid than me at the moment. Would also be nice to be able to buy a meal for myself on my birthday (Sep. 1st) instead of eating again white rice and teriyaki sauce lol. Probably a longshot but i'm in a position where it is worth it to try anything. Thank you for your time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest,\n\nu/kwa9 ",

        "body": "Hello, again, r/borrow community. I've posted the last 3 days trying to get the help I need. I am a first time borrower, but I have a good job where pay starts again end of September. I can provide employment information, ID, etc. I originally asked for 1100 (the amount I need), but realized that was too high for a first loan.  Here is my original post:\n\n I am recovering from the emotional and financial fallout from my divorce, and am short for my mortgage payment due Sept 1/18. I took a hit in the divorce and the trauma/unexpected nature of the circumstances (cheating, abandonment) caused me to spiral into depression. I gave up on caring about my life, and fell behind on my financial obligations.\n\nI am finally getting back on my feet and caught up on a lot of overdue payments, but will face serious consequences, like non-renewal of my mortgage, if I don't make this mortgage payment on time. I work full time and can provide proof of employment, ID, or any info you need to feel comfortable with this loan. I worked extra days this summer and will receive my summer pay when my regular pay stream starts again on Sept 30, so repayment will not be an issue. Thank you for any help. \n\n",

I got a break, my friend included me in on his business opportunity. Now we need to wait a few months during the build. My son is going through an application for disability funding, I am stuck in a 3 bedroom house with 4 other adults, sharing a bed with my boy in a sectioned off area in the lounge room. When it rains, it pours. After going through multiple testing for why I am beginning to lose function in my hands and why I am experiencing pain in other parts of my body, I am told that I need to go in for this procedure. And because it is non life threatening, I need to pay upfront. I have a window that I can get this done. But I can't wait much longer. I have no family that live in my state. I have no friends. I knew that this probably wouldn't work, and I am a little glad it didn't as I despise begging. I wish I could delete it now, but that would just make me look a little deceitful.

        "body": "Hey all! First off, I 'actually' need to borrow a bit more than this..but I wanted to start here to show my credibility, as this is my first request to borrow. Quick summation of where I'm at: My family and I are currently trying to get security/concierge company off the ground. Licensed, insured, business cards printed, almost there! We are working with very little though, only one outside investment that did most of the bulk work. Well a couple months ago, my car caught fire driving down the highway, nothing back in insurance (no fire insurance...) so I was without a car for some time. I finally found an affordable beater in my area which, with my beautiful luck, turned out to have some shoddy welding work rendering it (to me) unrepairable, and am now sitting on that cost while I wait to sell it for parts, again, carless all the while. Needless to say it has been hard for me to get around to work, since we all live in Western MA and we are taking our business mostly to Boston area. I'm trying not to make this too wordy, just want to portray my legitimacy! Basically being back on the road again would help me handle some bills at hand by being able to work once more, but more importantly help me contribute to getting the company rolling. My hopes are I can work this borrowing up to where I can just buy a car worry-free and pay off the loan in about a month's time. My hopes are also to be a lender on here, as I've literally dreamed of a service like this for all to use!!\n\nSorry for the essay, please feel free to ask any personally verifying/identifying questions to make you feel more secure in your loan. Thanks for reading! :)",

I originally had someone approach me in my pm and say they\u2019d help me. Me, being incredibly desperate to get rent paid, did what they asked for verification. Which included pictures of me with my ID, pay stubs, address, etc. They only replied back when I accused them of stealing my information, saying they\u2019d send the money this morning. Well they didn\u2019t. And I\u2019ve since then reported them. Now I\u2019m back here for a 3rd consecutive day asking if anyone is able to help me out. Im a landscaper and work at target for extra money. I need the loan to get rent paid. I fell behind because I fell extremely ill for the last month. I\u2019m here from Seattle helping my father and I refuse to let him down and lose everything I\u2019ve been doing. If there\u2019s anyone out there, I get I\u2019m a first time poster, but I\u2019m responsible and you have my word I\u2019ll pay you back on time. \n\n20% interest per month is what I put it at being a first time loan\n\nI originally asked for $750.\n\nMy good friend was able to shoot me $150 after hearing what original lender did. \n\nI\u2019m kind of in a hurry and right spot that\u2019s why I keep posting and no I can\u2019t get a loan elsewhere as my hospital bills before I got health insurance (I had a lot of health issues as a teen & young adult with no insurance) have made me unable to even think about it. \n\nHope one of you out there sees this. \n\nThank you for consideration.\n\n",

A couple weeks ago, I was driving down the freeway when my hood unlatched, flew up and shattered my windshield and damaged the roof and the hood itself in the process. I had the body work done but had a $500 deductible I had to pay. I picked my car up from the shop, and while I was driving home, my engine blew... which led me to have to purchase a new vehicle. So I have a shiny new car payment to deal with plus an annual increase in rent.\n\nI just got paid yesterday and doing the math, I can tell I'm still going to come up short this pay with everything that's going on. The bills will managed to be paid but I have almost nothing left for food or gas, and drive a lot for my job. I went to two different plasma donation clinics yesterday and both told me I couldn't donate because my veins were too small. So I'm posting on here as a last resort. The next time I get paid will be on 9/7. I will absolutely repay the $60 that day. Thank you in advance to anyone who reads this and is able to help. ",

I took a hit in the divorce and the trauma/unexpected nature of the circumstances (cheating, abandonment) caused me to spiral into depression. I gave up on caring about my life, and fell behind on my financial obligations.\n\nI am finally getting back on my feet and caught up on a lot of overdue payments, but will face serious consequences, like non-renewal of my mortgage, if I don't make this mortgage payment on time. I work full time and can provide proof of employment, ID, or any info you need to feel comfortable with this loan. I worked extra days this summer and will receive my summer pay when my regular pay stream starts again on Sept 30, so repayment will not be an issue. Thank you for any help. \n",

No big deal usually except the payroll company that I worked for on this show (I am Union Stagehand IATSE Local 720) has not had me on one of there calls in quite some time. During my hiatus from them, they created a new web portal for the employees to fill out all of their hiring, taxes, emergency contacts paperwork, etc.\n\nHaving filled all of this out I was fairly happy knowing that I would be getting a decent check from them for my time effort. Boy, was I wrong. The usual girl who handles the direct deposits wasn't in the office due to how large the show was that they had going on. Her temporary helper decided to use my old hard copy direct deposit form instead of my new and updated one. Thus my paycheck was sent to an old, closed Wells Fargo account. Having caught this error on my check stub, I called them to get them to fix it. \n\nBad news is they won't be able to send the check to me until they get it back from Wells Fargo which could be as late as Wednesday. Then I have to wait for them to send it to me. So I'm currently looking at finally getting paid by Friday possibly. I'm pretty broke right now and could use some floater cash for dog food, groceries, gas money, etc until this is all resolved. I'll pay you back by no later than Sept 14, 2018 and will include an interest payment for $40 upon payment. \n\nI really appreciate any one who took the time to read this and anyone who can help as well. I'll gladly provide any documents or information that you want/need. Thank you in advance. ",

        "body": "Hello, my wife and I are hoping to secure a loan of $685, to repay the lender from one of my existing loans and help us get through a tight end of the month due to expenses for pet supplies unexpectedly being slightly higher. The payments on my current loan, while always on time, are taking slightly longer for the lender and I than we anticipated, and with that in mind, the lender is unable to extend the loan beyond the original timeframe we expected, since some bulk payouts I am expecting have yet to come to fruition. I want to ensure that the lender is paid in full - not just because it's obviously the right thing to do, but especially because they helped my wife and I through pretty desperate times that are finally disippating.\n\nThe aforementioned lender has been kind enough to agree to post on this request after while, when able to do so.\n\n\n\n\nBackground/reason we need the funds:\n\nI was receiving disability insurance from my former employer while awaiting my SSI Disability hearing date due to my Multiple Sclerosis and severe spinal issues worsening to where I was no longer able to work. Every few months, it seemed, the insurance company pulled my benefits and required all sorts of documentation to overturn their denial.\u00a0 My last appeal was sent in, and it is currently awaiting their review to potentially restart those benefits. Going without that income for so long hit us hard, and everything added up over time as we were only getting by on my wife's own SSDI benefits (~$710/month).  The GREAT news is that I had my own SSDI hearing yesterday, and it went imcredibly well. My lawyer and I are beyond confident that I will be approved, and he estimates from their current backlog of approvals that it will likely take 6-12 weeks to receive the approval letter, and then shortly after that to receive what looks to be at least six months of back pay, and likely more, depending upon how far back the judge sets my onset date (which he discussed at the hearing - it could be anywhere from six months payable to over 4 years, depending upon their calculations).\n\n\n\n\nAbility to repay:\n\n-As mentioned, my wife receives $710 per month from SSI Disability due to the lingering effects of having fought cancer.\u00a0 It comes on the 3rd of each month, typically.\n\n-I was receiving $1,499.99 per month from the disability insurance, and will receive the past few months as a lump-sum back pay check once this current denial is overturned, if that happens before my SSDI approval. (I can't get both SSDI and private disability insurance, so the first one to approve the payment is the one we would be able to repay the loan with.)\n\n--Obviously, the SSDI income and back pay I should be receiving soon will be a huge boost in our ability to repay, as well.\n\n-We also receive settlement checks from time to time for anywhere between $200-$5,000 from my father's asbestosis-related death. We average getting five or six of these per year, but of course, as each manufacturer or distributor's legal fund drains, I expect them to slow down at some point down the road.\u00a0 We have one such check currently due to us for $3,500, but it has been taking an inordinate amount of time to receive, and the people I've contacted have not been much help beyond the usual \"it will come eventually\" response since they don't seem to keep exact track of each payment.\n\n\n\nSo between my wife's income from her disability, either my disability insurance that will be paid again once the denial is overturned, or when my SSDI benefits start paying (hopefully very soon), we can be flexible in working out payment arrangements.\u00a0 We just don't have the ability to pay this current loan at the end of its agreed upon timeframe off fully until these things occur, and on top.of that, I've added an estimation to cover the PayPal transfer fees and a small amount around $50, from my calculations, to help my wife and I cover our needs until her next benefits payment. Hence, my total figure of $685. My offer is $175 on top of that for interest, but I am flexible regarding any of these terms within our abilities.\n\n\n\n\nOur proposed repayment plan for the loan:\n\nAgain, we are flexible regarding the payment arrangements. Ideally, we can start by repaying $60 per month, on the 3rd of each month, or sooner in the event of holidays on the 3rd (SSDI typically pays on the 1st during those months when it cannot pay on the 3rd). This would continue until either we get my disability insurance denial overturned again (we've successfully fought through this process four times previously in the past few years) and receive the past several months worth of back pay through that insurer; or until we receive my SSDI back pay and first benefit check; or until we receive the asbestosis settlement check that has not come as of yet,  or get another asbestosis offer and check before any of the other aforementioned options occur.  I want to conservatively say that it could take up to 4-8 months, with that in mind, for us to be able to finish repaying the loan via these larger amounts we are looking at receiving in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask here or message me.\u00a0 Of course, proof of anything I've said is available upon request.\n\n\nThank you for your time.",

        "body": "  Hi all, made two requests recently and had someone on the sub question my credibility due to my last loaner not being consistently active on Reddit.  Had potential loaners ghost me last minute despite me being able to provide proof of address, paystubs, ID, and social media (after sending, which was probably a bit of bad judgement on my end as well).  I'm not sure what went wrong, but I'm still in (close to) dire need of assistance.  I figure my best bet at this point to build credibilty would be to ask for a small loan that I can pay back in a week and then try again for my bigger request.  If anyone can help out it would be greatly appreciated.  As I mentioned before, I can provide any type of information needed and am usually very quick to respond.  ",

I am helping my father as he\u2019s struggling after losing his job of 20 years. After everything, I\u2019m late by $750 which is half of what my check would have been. I\u2019m asking for the loan so I can pay rent and I\u2019ll pay $1000 by October 5th. Any questions or proof of identity; anything. Feel free to contact me on here.

I'm really tying everything I can think of. I've sold everything worth value. I can't get a loan from a financial institute because I don't have any collateral and barely any credit.  I was raised poor and never taught about that kind of stuff.  And that's coming back to bite me in the ass. I'm a chick in my 20s that's just in a tough spot and any help would be appreciated. I have until next week to pay the ticket off. Feel free to ask me anything.  I'm just at a total loss right now and not sure what else to so. Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you so much.",

        "body": "Well, it stinks to have to do this, but it's the only way to make what I'm doing work. I figured a 15% interest rate would be fine, but feel free to let me know if it's not enough. I only found out that this sub exists yesterday.\n\nI worked a commission-only job since October, but it didn't work out. Business got slow, and I ended up in dire straights monetarily. I sank 2.5 years into the job total, with training and everything. 2 weeks ago, I decided to cut my losses and go back to school, but am having issues with my government subsidized loans since I'm not in good academic standing from when I tried college as a teen.\n\nI have to do 2 classes out of pocket, and then can rely on loans while I invest in my future once I'm back in good academic standing. I was also banking on those to pay my rent, which I'm 3 weeks late on. I've also been trying to find a part time job, but no matter what job I get there's no way I can pay last and this month's rent on time.\n\nMy roommate has been helping me out since he knows my situation, and he doesn't mind much. But I feel horrible leaning on him so much. He's taking a trip to Europe soon, and he won't say it, but I know he really needs his money. Putting him out another $550 isn't an option.\n\nHere's the kicker:\n\nI found out yesterday that I have about $2,700 in my 401K (I thought it was only a couple 100 at most), and will have about $2,300 after withdrawing it.\n\nThis was amazing news. I could pay my rent AND make my classes this semester. I took the opportunity to sign up for classes, but the payment date is August 27th. My check won't get to my by then, and I can't put that wait time plus another month's rent on my roommate. Plus, if I don't make this date, I'll be screwed and have to wait a whole semester to start school. This would be horrible, since it will slow down my track significantly.\n\nI only have to pay for one class now, as the other has a late September start date. In total I need $550 for last month's rent, and $400 and some change for the class. The check should be here by 09/15, but I rather have a buffer in case something happens with the mail.\n\nI know it's a lot of money, but I really can't express how much this loan would help me. I would never accept it if I didn't know 100% that I can pay it back on time. I'm more than happy to provide any information about myself that my lender requests.\n\nThank you in advance for reading.\n\n\u200b\n\nEDIT:  My apologies, I forgot to put the \"repay\" amount in the title. At 15% interest, I'd pay back my lender $1150. \n\n\u200b",

My time is running out to pay the debt and I'd really appreciate any help I can get. Please contact me if you have any questions.\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI've borrowed on here before and am in need of another loan. The short story is that I need to clear up a legal issue and don't have the cash, and I need it by Friday afternoon.\n\nThe longer story is that I spent the past year making a lot of mistakes. I was very depressed and not taking care of myself. I wasn't paying my bills, I lost my insurance and wasn't taking my medications, I almost lost my car - everything was falling apart. A few months ago I realized what I was doing and started fixing my errors.\n\nI'm currently working two jobs and have paid off most of my past due bills or have at least negotiated payment plans. There's one bill I have not been successful in paying or negotiating and two days ago was served papers to appear in court on August 27 or pay the amount in full before then to avoid further fees. The debt is valid and it is in my best interest to pay in person on Friday afternoon rather than go to court.\n\nI'm willing to answer any questions or provide any proof needed. Please let me know if you're able to help.",

        "body": "Hello gang, I'm currently a Junior (Redshirt-Soph) Student athlete attending West Chester University studying business management here requesting $1,000 for the purchase of a laptop for this upcoming Fall Semester. \n\nI posted recently requesting more money for the potential purchases that could be made for the upcoming school year. However, I was told by a fellow lender that since I was a new member to this subreddit getting the amount I requested off the bat was unlikely. \n\nTherefore, I have lowered the amount of my request. The most important school supply I need for this year (& a necessity for college) is a good laptop thus the reason for the amount requested. I receive a refund check from the University for my tuition since I am a student athlete on full athletic scholarship & I also receive a monthly stipend from the NCAA/University that covers many expenses such as housing, food & whatever expenses we need to cover in our off campus life. The only issues is the timing of when we receive these checks as students. Anyone who is familiar with college refund checks knows they can come at any time. Us athletes have priority scheduling for our classes so our (tuition/class fees) get processed first & we usually receive  our checks within the first full month of school which is Sep. \n\nTherefore, I am certain I will be able to repay the loan with interest in time or early depending on when I receive my checks from WCU.\n\nI work in the Summer & Spring as a Caddy & an advisor at several youth sports camps instructing minors. However, I don't work in the Fall & Winter due to Football & the amount of time it consumes throughout the school year. \n\nAs a business major I know one rule in finance is to never play with other people's money. So any help you guys can provide for me would be lovely I won't let you down. Appreciate it thank you! \n",

I am recovering from the emotional and financial fallout from my divorce, and am short for my mortgage payment due Sept 1/18. I took a hit in the divorce and the trauma/unexpected nature of the circumstances (cheating, abandonment) caused me to spiral into depression. I gave up on caring about my life, and fell behind on my financial obligations.\n\nI am finally getting back on my feet and caught up on a lot of overdue payments, but will face serious consequences, like non-renewal of my mortgage, if I don't make this mortgage payment on time. I work full time and can provide proof of employment, ID, or any info you need to feel comfortable with this loan. I worked extra days this summer and will receive my summer pay when my regular pay stream starts again on Sept 30, so repayment will not be an issue. Thank you for any help. \n\nEdit: added information about my circumstances and income. \n",

Can repay $550 with $50 bi-weekly payments. Last payment will be 11/29 in the amount of $150. I probably can pay back sooner on 10/19 with my birthday money. ",

Being in the hospital and then being on bed rest, (had to get a procedure done to figure out what it was. If you\u2019d like to know I\u2019ll tell you), I had lost a pretty good amount of work/pay and have fallen behind on bills. The bill that I need paid is rent. I am helping my father as he\u2019s struggling after losing his job of 20 years. After everything, I\u2019m late by $750 which is half of what my check would have been. I\u2019m asking for the loan so I can pay rent and I\u2019ll pay $1000 by September 7th. Any questions or proof of identity; anything. Feel free to contact me on here. I\u2019m a landscaper and I\u2019d like to think of myself as a very trustworthy person. Fell into troubled times and this is the only way I can seem to get a loan in God bless and thank you for your consideration. ",

As previously stated, the loan is to pay the **security deposit and first month's rent** in advance.\n\nI will be **earning a monthly salary** which will be used to **repay the loan in full with interest**. I am open to negotiating the monthly repayments, my prefered repayment is as follows:\n\n **30/09 - \u00a3200 ; 30/10 - \u00a3250 ; 30/11 - \u00a3300 ; 30/12 - \u00a3400 ; 30/01 - \u00a3450.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also **open to borrowing the total sum from 2 lenders** and negotiating the interest with them.\n\nI have kept good communication with my lenders regularly throughout the loan and have always paid back on time or early. I have also been a lender on here as well. \n\nI hope someone is able to help me in my situation and if you require any information/ID/proof I will be more than happy to provide it.\n\n&#x200B;",

I've lost my job 2 months ago, and so far i was pretty much  able to pay for everything on my own. But i ran out of funds, and i have  to pay my rent, which is due on monday, August 27. I already found a  new job, but since i get paid monthly, and i began working 2 days ago, i  won't be able to return the money in september, but i should be easilly  able to give it back in october, and i can add extra $50.  \nThank you in advance, and i'll appreciate any available help. I'll submit any additional info you'll want to know. ",

I'm working now but I desperately need a car to get to work and to use for the move. Money will be used for a down payment.\n\n**Full story:** I\u2019m moving out of state in 2 months and I was working 50~ hours a week at a well paying job to save up for the move, and then everything kind of started falling apart. First, my department got closed down. Luckily I\u2019d saved enough to still make the move. However, now my car has completely broken down and I desperately need a car for the move/general purpose. This money will go towards a down payment on a car. I will likely not be able to make this move without a car, and I\u2019ve got others heavily relying on me to make it. I can do weekly payments starting in October, or whatever works for the loaner.\n\nI realize this is a large amount for a first time borrower, as I\u2019ve seen people say that here. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have the time to build up a reputation here, as I\u2019m moving in a little under 2 months.\n\nI will provide any and all contact info needed to keep up with payments and answer questions. This loan would be legitimately life changing for me in my current state. It would be amazing if someone came through on this. I appreciate all your consideration and help in advance. Thank you everyone!",

I was very depressed and not taking care of myself. I wasn't paying my bills, I lost my insurance and wasn't taking my medications, I almost lost my car - everything was falling apart. A few months ago I realized what I was doing and started fixing my errors. \n\nI'm currently working two jobs and have paid off most of my past due bills or have at least negotiated payment plans. There's one bill I have not been successful in paying or negotiating and two days ago was served papers to appear in court on August 27 or pay the amount in full before then to avoid further fees. The debt is valid and it is in my best interest to pay in person on Friday afternoon rather than go to court.\n\nI'm willing to answer any questions or provide any proof needed.

I have to first get there to obtain the money I spend during the move. \n\nI have sold most of my property, and am not even renting a Uhaul. I'm taking my old SUV and whatever valuables I can carry, sleeping in the truck on the way, and will AirBnB until the first check comes, at which point I can afford repayment, and to rent an apartment. \n\nThe reason I can't get a loan via traditional methods is since I got out of the army, I did a lot of drinking and couldn't land a good job. I have been broke for years. I've been sober now for 4 months (thanks r/stopdrinking) and was offered a position that pays $34/hr plus full benefits and room for more money as time goes on. \n\nI have never been offered this amount of money. Im excited beyond belief for the opportunity, but actually getting there is expensive as I have a 35 hour drive ahead. I leave on the 6th of September, and hope to secure the funds at least a few days prior so I can service my truck and to feel confident I can make it. \n\nI would actually hope for an even bigger loan, but can make it with the $1000. I will repay any amount up to $2000 at 150% interest on October 2, 2018. Will provide proof of identity, numerous methods of contact, and sign a contract if one can legally be enforced.

Just graduated from nursing school and will be taking my NCLEX soon, I've already applied to hospitals, clinics, etc but will hire me only after I'm licensed. They also can't hold the position for me as in my area is it very competitive. I'm in need of a loan to help pay for my bills and rent that have accumulated, and I'm very behind in them.\n\nI'll be receiving my last pay check using all of my PTO hours I've accumulated from my PRN job so I'll be able to pay back $600 by 8/31/18 with no issues.",

I\u2019ll still have more rent to pay after the $1500 by October but the minimum to avoid eviction is $1500 before the 31st of this month. I\u2019m making a promise to pay back the full $1750 to one lender or $1500 between more and the additional funds agreed upon for each by 1/31/19 or earlier. This will be more than enough time to get myself back on track. And be able to cover the other half of rent and then save and budget. ",

        "body": "Hello fellow lenders & borrowers. I'm new to this subreddit so spare me if I mess up anything thank you just here looking for some help & assistance thanks! \n\nWith that said, I am here seeking a loan to cover the expenses of my college move-in weekend. Expenses such as a new laptop MOST importantly, books, furniture, meal plan, & any sort of house grocery or appliances needed for the new school year. Any & all remaining $ received from the loan that is not used for school related  material will go towards the repayment of the loan or business ventures/investments.\n\nI attend West Chester University on a full athletic scholarship & receive a refund check for my tuition along with a monthly stipend check from my school/NCAA that will most definitely cover the entirety of this loan for starters. Anyone who knows how refund checks work in college would know that you don't receive you refund until a couple weeks of school go by, sometimes even more than that reasons why this loan would be much appreciated so I can accomplish everything that comes with moving in without having to wait for those checks from the school.\n\nI'm a business management major going into my Junior Year in the classroom, Soph year on the field. So if there's anything I'm good at it's managing & making money. & the one rule I learned from Business is to not play with other peoples money so that's definitely something I'm not tryna do. That's bad karma.\n\nI rent out a 5 bedroom house along with my teammates & make constant $600 rent payments along with utilities & cable/wifi each month. I don't work during the fall/winter due to football & the amount of time it consumes. However, I Caddy & participate in several youth sports camps instructing kids during the Spring & Summer when not in season mode. \n\nLike I said before I receive a monthly stipend since I am an student-athlete that will cover the cost of the loan most likely & if not my refund check will cover all cost of the loan if necessary. Please let me know if anyone is willing to help , trying to have a smooth & stress free move in process. If there are any questions or any type of verification needed I'm here to answer & provide. Anything can help I appreciate you all, thanks!",

A few unexpected expenses a couple weeks ago has left us off balance. $50 (+$15) isn't going to solve the problem entirely, but like last time, it's an amount I have no concerns about being able to pay back in time, and I have friends/family that might be able to make up the difference, if needed. I can repay by next payday (8/31), possibly earlier if I can pick up a little side work before then.\n\nThanks for reading and for your consideration.",

Thanks in advanced.\n\n\n\nWell some good news, after someone quit I'm gonna be doing overtime for the next 2 months. But unfortunately I do not have enough money to make it to my next payday. I have another loan on that repayment date but with the extra bump in income I will be able to pay both that loan and when/if I get it, this loan as well. I have been having an issue with PayPal where even though I have used it several times now the G&S just isn't working. When I called they said it's because it would be a first time sell. I apologize as it will have to be F&F, both previous loans that I paid back were also F&F. Thank you for your time.",

I moved from TN to New England after getting into an MFA program, and did not find out until after the move that the financial package I had been offered was more or less a lie. (Hidden fees nestled under the header \"tuition\" though 100% tuition remission was promised.) My boyfriend and I got jobs, lost them right before Christmas, and haven't been able to find work since. HOWEVER, I have assistantships through my program and both of us attended an onboarding for Amazon, so there will be money...just not for approximately four weeks. \n\nWe've been surviving off of the kindness of friends, family, and sometimes even strangers, but the windfalls cannot come forever. On Saturday, we will be checking out of our AirBnb and will have nowhere to go and no food to eat. (Am currently working with a food pantry, but with no access to cooking or a fridge, this is hard.) I have no money for my medications or for gas to get us anywhere safe to sleep in my car. No money for the train nor textbooks. I am scared. Scared enough to ask for help from strangers. \n\nFive hundred isn't enough, but I'd feel (even) worse for requesting more, so that's what I am hoping for. In terms of a payback date, I am thinking 9/25--my paycheck and meager student loan money will have come in by then. As for interest, I have no idea what is fair. I am open to discuss this, of course! \n\nIf there are any questions, I am happy to answer them. ",

A few months ago a red light camera got me and I was billed for $374.00 bucks But, I cant afford to pay that at the moment because i just paid my college classes and that took all my current savings. \n\nMy plan is to use that money to have my license un-suspended and become a lyft driver to earn the money back and use that money earned to pay whomever back and also regrow my savings. ***I can provide all types of identification if needed as well as pay-stubs*** \n\nI do currently have a job as a Shift Supervisor here in Miami Beach and I do get paid fairly well, so I can assure the lender the money back within the estimated time frame ( OCT, 15, 2018) and more than likely a lot sooner! I also offer to pay you back in the amount of $550.00 dollars as my token of appreciation.\n\nThank you so much!",

If anybody is will to help I will pay an extra $100 totaling $700 by September 31st. I would need this loan for about 5 weeks. Thanks so much",

I've done various sales jobs (and excelled) at them during my twenties (I'm in my late twenties now) but really felt that I was missing a serious specialization and certification to really develop a career, hence the coding bootcamp. I'm incredibly excited to get started, however going back to school as an adult is extremely different (especially since this coding bootcamp is 9-5) than as a high school graduate, and it leaves little room for free time, much less a job. I was originally going to start a .NET bootcamp in late October but received a call today from them saying that they had a Javascript bootcamp with a last minute cancellation in September, which gives me a whole month and some change less to save.\n\nMy old sales position wasn't comfortable with me going part time evening shifts for school (and I really don't blame them, considering it was a 9-5 in and of itself, they don't really have evening shifts) so I begin a new job on Thursday. It pays a lot less but I like the people there, it allows for part time/flexible with my schedule,  and most importantly the ability to work remotely once you're out of training, so it will be my new job until the end of January. I'm needing some assistance in paying some bills that are coming up soon as money is pretty tight right now with the transition, it feels like I'm juggling a million things, but will be able to pay back next month once I have some steady income again.\n\nIt's my first time posting here, so forgive me for the essay. Not really sure how to go about this, PM me I suppose if you're interested.\n\nThanks guys.",

Basically just looking for $200 for \"get by\" money until my next paycheck comes due, at which point I'll repay the $200 loan with $240. My next paycheck will have me fully caught up and then some on everything, just need to get there is all! I have very low expenses, this is just a one time windfall expense until my financial aid is received. \n\nI get paid on the 31st, but it's a paper check which I'll need to cash the next day, so you'll receive your money that weekend on either 9/1 or 9/2 of 2018.\n\nThanks for your time and consideration :).",

I estimated wrongly the amount of hours I worked and got less than I thought in my most recent paycheck which is why I am forced to look to strangers for help.

A few months ago a red light camera got me and I was billed for $374.00 bucks But, I cant afford to pay that at the moment because I just paid for my College classes and that took all my current savings.\n\nMy plan is to use that money to have my license un-suspended and Get back on LYFT and use that money earned to pay back the loan and also regrow my savings.\n\nI do currently have a job as a Shift Supervisor here in Miami Beach and I do get paid fairly well, so I can assure the lender the money back within the estimated time frame ( OCT, 15, 2018) and more than likely a lot sooner! I also offer to pay you back in the amount of $550.00 dollars as my token of appreciation.\n\nThank you so much!",

My manager explained I\u2019m working against a hidden clock and i don\u2019t want to involve legal so need to pay full before any court date. \nI\u2019ve had several great loans, all paid on time and well communicated. \n\nI can repay 20% in 6 biweekly payments of $160 on 9/14, 9/28, 10/12, 10/26, 11/9, 11/23.\n\nOriginally, I requested a larger amount. My current wonderful lender (majority of current loan paid, and finishing at end of this month) Kashifr agreed to helping with half so I will have ONLY one other 2000 loan during this time which I make biweekly payments on. \n\nMy only bills, besides the above loan, are for 1/2 of rent, and car insurance. utilities are included and I spend maybe $100 on food/basics.\nMy rent will be only half as I have a new roommate moving in the end of this month.\n\nI work several jobs, such as acting gigs, dog walking, escape room, lyft/Uber, etc. \nand can provide proof of income or invoices. \nas well as any further verification or answers to questions. \n\nLet me know if you can help or are willing to split! If there\u2019s a preferred arrangement, we can discuss. \n\nAs said before, I might have been disorganized to have gotten myself in the situation ( as well as previous roommate leaving prematurely) but I treat my loans as a priority and have good history. This subreddit is greatly appreciated! \n\nThank you! ",

Pay off my smaller loans that will be due in the next 1-3 weeks as I will be my salaried pay starting after having worked 20 days of next month after receiving one last weekly check. instead of my weekly/hourly pay. (Don\u2019t worry loaners, if I\u2019m not able to get this loan filled I\u2019ll grind at my side job to ensure all loans are paid out on time and efficiently). And 2. To make rent for this month for the same reason as the previously stated point. \n\nI\u2019ve taken out 27 loans for a total of $3,977.

I have been making consistent payments on this loan, and owe approx. $1,500. I would be devoting a portion of this current request to that loan, so as to consolidate what I owe. \n\nThe crux of the payback plan would be bi-weekly payments of $350, starting on Friday, 8/31. I would need to add a bit more to 2-3 of those payments, in order to hit the $5,000 mark before PayPal's dispute period ends. We can certainly work out the specific dates for those larger payments. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions/concerns. Thanks!",

I\u2019m a little behind on a few bills and I still need to purchase some new supplies for my classroom. \n\nHowever the bigger issue at the moment is that the breaks in my car need some major replacement work done, which was totally unexpected. Whether I do some of the work myself or bring it into a mechanic for some, it will still be spendy, which I can\u2019t afford right now. \n\nI would really appreciate any help. I am pretty positive I will be able to pay of any loan far earlier than in the little payment plan I wrote out says (which is flexible) but I just wanted to be safe by putting down a later date.\n\t- Sept. 15 - $200\n\t- Oct. 15 - $200\n\t- Nov. 15 - $200\n\t- Dec. 15 - $200\n\t- Jan. 15 - $200\n\t- Feb. 15 - $200\n\nFeel free to message me for any additional info!

I was out of work the past two months; which drained my savings. I tried to borrow a loan at high interest rate loan centers but they wouldn't loan without a recent pay stub/source of income. Then I remembered about this sub. The reason for the month long loan is because the new job pays bi-weekly and my rent has to be paid on (09/05), so the first paycheck will have to go towards that. The next paycheck will come on (09/14), which is when I'll pay the loan back.  \nMy account is 4+ years old with 1800\\~ karma, but I haven't logged on or posted for a long while.

I can't pay the rent and other bills on time and I'm starting to get worried that I might go to other riskier options. Fortunately I worked at dining services before and I am definitely sure I'm going to be okay afterwards. I can provide proof of my identity, status, work, and address. I can also split to two lenders and be flexible on the borrowed amount.\n\nEdit: I have one person who can do half of the amount.",

I'm about right where I should be, in order to pay off a previous small loan I took, as well as paying other billls. However, I cant afford to be set back at the moment. I'll take an extra shift or do whatever I have to, and will be able to pay back by next week if anyone is willing to help me out. I am willing to pay $80 back on or before 08/23 (next week).

        "body": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI hoped I would never have to come back here. I'm up in Alaska visiting my parents, and I knew money would be tight, but I did not expect it to be this tight. I woke up this morning to $48.89 in my bank account and that's after just getting paid 4 days ago. Most of this is because I just paid my mortgage and then cell phone payments just came out last night, I guess. I know $500 is a bit much to ask which is why I'm offering to repay with 10% interest($50). Obviously anything less would be great, but I'm willing! :)\n\nI am in the US Air Force, so I get paid on the 1st/15th every month(1 business day early thanks to USAA) so that is why I say my repay date will be before 9/15. With my first paycheck, I really want to pay off what will be overdue bills on the 1st of the month before I repay off this loan, but I expect that will be less than $300. This money will also be used to buy food because I fly/drive home on the 20th, and my MIL has decided she wants to show up at my house for 4 days on the 21st. We have no food in the house whatsoever, because we ate everything before going on vacation.\n\nI can provide proof if identity through photo IDs(Sorry, I'm not allowed to take pictures of my DoD ID, although I am able to provide proof of service through an official DoD memo should you request it(I have the PDF on my computer). I am not able to verify my address, due to me not being home right now, and the address on my DL does not match my home address due to me remaining a resident of MO but living in MT).\n\nAny additional information can be provided upon request. Any help would be appreciated... I still have 2 weeks left in this month and am beginning to worry a tiny bit about money. You can see from my previous records(assuming they show) that I generally repay my loans early and keep constant contact with my loan provider.\n\nThanks,\n\nLucioGhosty",

        "body": "I am new to this and I hope that I can hear back from someone relatively soon. I am a student in college and I depend upon financial aid to fund my education. In short, my FAFSA had the wrong school listed, and in order to not be dropped from all of my classes, I need to arrange a payment plan for my tuition expenses. The fee to for the first payment is just shy of $450. I will be receiving a refund from the school once my financial aid is processed, but that will take about a month or two to do. I am hoping that someone will be able to help me out so I don't need to go to the bank and get a loan. I understand if anyone has any apprehensions concerning me, but I guarantee that as soon as I have the money from the refund I will repay you immediately. Thank you.",

        "body": "Hey everyone! I'm happy to say that I'm in the transition to a new job where I'll have better pay and great hours. Only downside is that there will be a little gap in paychecks due to the timing of the switch, so I hope to get a loan to bridge that gap. Note that this won't affect either of my existing loans. I've made sure to work all that out and the new job will be huge in getting ahead of the game for repayment, with a 99% chance of paying both those off early.\n\nHere's the breakdown for repayment for this loan:\n\n\\- Friday, September 28th: $500\n\n\\- Friday, October 12th: $500\n\n\\- Friday, October 26th: $500\n\n\\- Friday, November 9th: $500\n\nNow as a heads-up, these are \"safe dates\" for me to make these repayment amounts. Most likely with the job change each payment will be higher, but I set it up this way because I know I'll be able to make these.\n\nThanks for your consideration! As always, I'm willing to provide any necessary information and can be flexible with interest if need be.\n\nEdit: If I can find 2 lenders to do 700 each and be repaid 1000 each, that works too if that's better for security.",

        "body": "I have an active loan taken out last week that will be repaid on the due date next Friday. Given this, and the fact I am new to the sub, I understand if a second request isn't appropriate right now but thought there's no harm in trying.\n\nMy pet rat has an infection from an operation he had a few weeks ago so I need to take him back to the vet. There is a \u00a340 consultation fee and the antibiotics were \u00a325 for the last course so likely to be the same cost again. Request is in order to get him seen this weekend.\n\nRepayment would be \u00a375 by PayPal next Friday, first thing in the morning,\n\nThanks",
